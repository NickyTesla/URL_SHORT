##URL Shortener

takes a url and gives you a link to a (hopefuly) shorter url

The basic idea is to store an encoded path that corresponds to a URL.  The path is looked up when the request hits the server and you are redirected to the corresponding URL.

The encoded path is generated by converting URL id's to a string of  [a-z], [0-9], and some special url safe characters.  This should minimize the length of the generated path.  

Could do with some more styling but ultimately this is just a middle man.  Styled it vaguely after google's url shortener
